# Project Ideas

## **Survey making app with markdown-like survey creation**

Create a web application that lets you create and send out simple surveys. Use a text based editor instead of a clumsy UI.

- Syntax highlighting and validation for editor.
- Register users with email. Unregistered users can only make one survey, but answer any amount. Redistered users can create and answer any amount.
- Send out link to answer a survey.
- Visualize answer data in a meaningful way.
- Recommended tools: Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, any database.

## **File handler**

Make a simple file handler for managing files and directories.

- Keyboard shortcuts for the most used commands. (customizable)
- Integrated terminal (or at the very least git)
- Clean desktop UI
- Dual directory display
- Recommended tools: Go
