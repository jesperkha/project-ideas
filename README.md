## **Survey making app with markdown-like survey creation**

Create a web application that lets you create and send out simple surveys. Use a text based editor instead of a clumsy UI.

- Syntax highlighting and validation for editor
- Register users with email. Unregistered users can only make one survey, but answer any amount. Redistered users can create and answer any amount
- Send out link to answer a survey
- Visualize answer data in a meaningful way
- Recommended tools: Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, any database

## **File handler**

Make a simple file handler for managing files and directories.

- Keyboard shortcuts for the most used commands. (customizable)
- Integrated terminal (or at the very least git)
- Clean desktop UI
- Dual directory display
- Recommended tools: Go

## **Basic programming language**

Design and create a simple programming/scripting language.

- Include all basic math and string operations
- Dynamic variable types
